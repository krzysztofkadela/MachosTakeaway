## Automated Testing

The Machos Takeaway project utilizes Django's built-in testing framework to ensure that all key functionalities work as expected. Below are the details of the tests implemented for various components of the application.

### Tests Overview

- **Reservation Tests**:
  - **`test_make_reservation`**: Verifies that a logged-in user can successfully create a reservation and receives a success message.
  - **`test_reservation_with_short_notice`**: Checks that a user cannot make a reservation less than 24 hours in advance, displaying an appropriate warning message.
  - **`test_cancel_reservation`**: Confirms that users can cancel their own reservations and receive a success message.
  - **`test_cancel_nonexistent_reservation`**: Tests that attempting to cancel a non-existent reservation results in the appropriate error handling.

- **Menu Tests**:
  - **`test_menu_view_status_code`**: Ensures that the menu view loads successfully with a status code of 200.
  - **`test_menu_view_template`**: Checks that the correct template is used to display the menu.
  - **`test_menu_view_context`**: Verifies that the context contains the expected menu items.

- **Main Page Tests**:
  - **`test_main_page_loads`**: Tests that the main page loads successfully with a status code of 200.
  - **`test_main_page_template_used`**: Ensures that the correct template is used when rendering the main page.
  - **`test_main_page_context`**: Checks that the context of the main page contains the expected number of approved comments.

- **JavaScript Tests**:
  - **Alert Functionality**: 
    - The JavaScript tests verify that auto-closing alert messages disappear after a specified time and can be smoothly faded out.
    - Tests utilize **Jest** and **@testing-library/jest-dom** to ensure DOM manipulation occurs as expected.
