## Deployment:

### This app was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku

   #### Simple steps:

   * Fork or clone this repository
   * Create a new Heroku app
   * Set the build packs to Python and NodeJs in that order
   * Link the heroku app to the repository
   * Click on Deploy
   * Live "Natures Oils Stock System" app you can find by clicking this link:
     [heroku](https://naturesoilsstock-9ab4d188a6d6.herokuapp.com/)


## Bugs Detected:
  * When testing the function  "update_stock(choice, product_list)" and function "update worksheet()",
    there was a problem with the correct data being retrieved from the "Tuple" that the first function returned.
    The worksheet was not updated and a message about incorrect data appeared.
  * The problem was solved by changing the 'Tuple' to a 'List' and converting the numeric input to integer.
  
## Unfixed Bugs:
  * All detected bugs have been fixed.
