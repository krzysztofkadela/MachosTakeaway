### Tests Overview
#### [Menu](#features)

- **Reservation Tests**:
  - **`test_make_reservation`**: Verifies that a logged-in user can successfully create a reservation and receives a success message.
  - **`test_reservation_with_short_notice`**: Checks that a user cannot make a reservation less than 24 hours in advance, displaying an appropriate warning message.
  - **`test_cancel_reservation`**: Confirms that users can cancel their own reservations and receive a success message.
  - **`test_cancel_nonexistent_reservation`**: Tests that attempting to cancel a non-existent reservation results in the appropriate error handling.

- **Menu Tests**:
  - **`test_menu_view_status_code`**: Ensures that the menu view loads successfully with a status code of 200.
  - **`test_menu_view_template`**: Checks that the correct template is used to display the menu.
  - **`test_menu_view_context`**: Verifies that the context contains the expected menu items.

- **Main Page Tests**:
  - **`test_main_page_loads`**: Tests that the main page loads successfully with a status code of 200.

## Bugs Detected:
#### [Menu](#features)

 - **Issue with Reservation Date Input**: 
  During the initial testing phase of the reservation functionality, it was discovered that the system allowed users to make reservations for past dates. This posed a significant concern as it would lead to confusion and inaccuracies in reservation management.
   **Resolution**: 
  The validation logic in the `ReservationForm` was updated to ensure that users cannot select a past date when trying to make a reservation. Now, only future dates are permitted for booking, enhancing the user experience and maintaining the integrity of reservations.
